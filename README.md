This app has two functions: First, to play a sound file in which users can control the volume of the sound file and the position in the file. There is a play/pause button to play/pause the file and a Loop button to have the sound file repeat.

The second function is 3 buttons that are linked to a short sound. There is a switch to turn the sound on/off. If the sound is off, a physical device will vibrate instead of make a sound. In the iPhone simulator, a Notification is displayed showing noting a vibration would have happened.
